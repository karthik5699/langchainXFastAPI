Mars Sample Return is going to have great stuff to choose from. The mission has concluded that the solar-powered lander has run out of energy after more than four years on the Red Planet. NASA's Curiosity Mars rover used its Mast Camera to capture a panorama of a hill nicknamed. NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance rover will look for signs of past microbial life, cache rock and soil samples, and prepare for future human exploration. Curiosity rover finds water-carved 'book' rock on Mars. A book-shaped rock on Mars was likely carved by ancient water running through the area. Mars' ancient climate had a wonderful complexity to it, much like Earth's. Since July, NASA's Perseverance rover has drilled and collected four slim cores of sedimentary rock, formed in what was once a lake on Mars.
